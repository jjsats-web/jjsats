Worklog - 2026-01-14

- Locked catalog-sourced line items so description/price are read-only in `components/LineItemsTable.tsx`, and set `locked` when adding catalog items in `app/page.tsx`.
- Added a manual product entry (name/code + price) and aligned the catalog/manual row layouts and button sizing in `app/page.tsx`.
- Extended the quote header box bottom padding in the PDF template (`app/page.tsx`).
- Enhanced Telegram approval messages with an inline button when the URL is public, with a safe fallback for localhost/private URLs; added reply markup support in `lib/telegram.ts`.
- Cleared the `.next` build output to address the invalid source map warning.
