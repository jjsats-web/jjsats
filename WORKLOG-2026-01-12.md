Worklog - 2026-01-12

- Built a PDF-like approval preview in `app/approve/[id]/page.tsx` and added layout styles in `app/approve/[id]/approve.css`.
- Fixed Thai mojibake/`????` text in the PDF template section of `app/page.tsx` (table headers, address, labels, discount).
- Added `/api/quote-approvals` GET to fetch latest approval status per quote and wired polling on the history list (10s).
- Converted the history action into a single button that switches between "ขออนุมัติ" and "ดาวโหลด"; guarded downloads until approved.
- Applied green styling to the approved download state; kept the rest of the button style unchanged.
- Switched the approval preview logo to `next/image` to satisfy lint.
