Worklog - 2026-01-13

- Made Telegram approval messages send HTML anchor links and escaped dynamic fields; extended `sendTelegramMessage` to support parse mode and preview options.
- Fixed duplicate `payload` variable in `lib/telegram.ts` to resolve the build error.
- Added a 10-minute cooldown for repeat approval requests in `/api/quote-approvals` with `retryAfterSeconds` in the response.
- Updated approval UI in `app/page.tsx` to track `requested_at`, show remaining minutes, and allow re-request after cooldown.
